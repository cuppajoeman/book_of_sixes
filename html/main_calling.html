<p> <strong>Main calling</strong> is the act of managing the team’s next move through comms. The best candidate for this role is typically the <strong>pocket scout</strong>, as they often have the best overall vision during a fight. While Soldiers are usually bombing in and potentially dying early, the pocket scout stays alive longer and maintains more consistent awareness. They’re also closely linked to the Medic—tracking their position, helping guide them, and moving together at scout speed. While any class can technically main call, the pocket scout is often the most optimal choice for these reasons. </p> <p> As a main caller, you need to know what to do in all standard situations: when you have an <strong>uber advantage</strong>, <strong>disadvantage</strong>, or the ubers are <strong>even</strong>—across every control point. You also need to actively assess both your team’s health and positions, as well as the enemy’s. </p> <p> To understand the importance of a main caller, consider what happens without one. Without a central voice leading the team, information doesn't get passed around efficiently. No one is clearly responsible for decision-making, and multiple conflicting ideas may emerge, slowing the pace and leading to missed opportunities or lost advantages. </p> <p> A designated main caller ensures that plans are centralized and clear. Teammates can still <strong>counter-call</strong> if they believe the plan isn’t viable, but having a primary caller avoids confusion and keeps the team aligned. In some cases, players healing up or repositioning may need to briefly delay a plan—but having a leader allows the team to work around that in a structured way. </p>
