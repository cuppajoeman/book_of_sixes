<h2>Class-Based Spatial Control</h2>

<h3>Scout</h3>
<p>
  A scout's spatial control can be visualized as a sphere centered around them. If an enemy enters that sphere, the scout can likely kill them quickly due to high mobility and damage output at close range.
</p>

<h3>Soldier</h3>
<p>
  A soldier’s control zone is more complex. It becomes much stronger when the soldier has height advantage, allowing them to shoot down onto enemies standing on flat ground. The splash damage from rockets is more effective from above, making elevated positions key for soldier dominance.
</p>

<h3>Demoman</h3>
<p>
  Demomen have one of the most impactful control zones. Their spatial control is defined by where they can place and detonate sticky bombs, along with the blast radius of each one. While they also have some control at close range using pipes, it is less reliable than a scout’s because hitting pipes at short range is more difficult.
</p>
<p>
  This is why Demoman is such a critical class—his control extends far beyond his physical position. His stickies can lock down areas, prevent movement, and shape the entire battlefield.
</p>

<h2>The Concept of Team Spatial Control</h2>
<p>
  Spatial control isn’t just about individual players—it’s about the <strong>bubble</strong> your team creates. This bubble defines the area you currently "own" in the game: space that the enemy cannot enter without taking a significant risk.
</p>
<p>
  Ideally, this bubble should form either:
  <ul>
    <li>A single large blob encompassing your entire team</li>
    <li>Two separate blobs: one for the combo and one for the flank</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  The shape and position of these bubbles determine which areas you can safely control and which flank routes are protected. If a flank route is not covered by your control area, the enemy can potentially sneak through and catch your team off-guard.
</p>

<h2>Feeding and the Risks of Overextension</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Feeding</strong> refers to when a player moves outside of the team’s protective bubble and dies without support. This is usually a mistake, as it gives the enemy a free pick and reduces your team's control.
</p>
<p>
  Feeding is only acceptable in very specific cases—such as a calculated sacrifice to kill or force the enemy medic. Otherwise, it weakens your team’s position and should be avoided.
</p>

<h2>Thinking Beyond the Individual</h2>
<p>
  Instead of thinking in terms of individual players, try to visualize your team as a collective <strong>blob</strong> of control. The question you should always be asking is: <em>“How much space do we own right now?”</em>
</p>
<p>
  Understanding and managing spatial control at a team level is what separates advanced teams from beginner ones. The more ground you safely control, the more pressure you exert—and the closer you get to winning the round.
